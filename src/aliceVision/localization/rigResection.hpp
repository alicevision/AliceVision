/**
 * @brief It computes the pose of a camera rig given the 2d-3d associations of 
 * each camera along with the internal calibration of each camera and the external 
 * calibration of the cameras wrt the main one.
 * 
 * @param[in] vec_pts2d A vector of the same size as the number of the camera in 
 * the rig, each element of the vector contains the 2d points of the associations 
 * for each camera.
 * @param[in] vec_pts3d A vector of the same size as the number of the camera in 
 * the rig, each element of the vector contains the 3d points of the associations 
 * for each camera. A 2d-3d association is represented by (vec_pts2d[i].col(j), vec_pts3d[i].col(j)).
 * @param[in] vec_queryIntrinsics A vector containing the intrinsics for each 
 * camera of the rig.
 * @param[in] vec_subPoses A vector containing the subposes of the cameras wrt 
 * the main one, ie the camera 0. This vector has numCameras-1 elements.
 * @param[in] descTypesPerCamera optional vector of describer types per camera.
 * It is used in the weighting stategy to decide if the resection is strongly supported.
 * @param[out] rigPose The rig pose referred to the position of the main camera.
 * @param[out] inliers A vector of the same size as the number of cameras c
 * ontaining the indices of inliers.
 * @param[in] threshold The threshold in radians to use in the ransac process. It
 * represents the maximum angular error between the direction of the 3D point in
 * space and the bearing vector of the feature (i.e. the direction of the 
 * re-projection ray).
 * @param[in] maxIterations Maximum number of iteration for the ransac process.
 * @param[in] verbosity Mute/unmute the debugging messages.
 * @return true if the ransac has success.
