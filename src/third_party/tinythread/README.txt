TinyThread++ v1.1
=================

About
-----

TinyThread++ is a minimalist, portable, threading library for C++, intended to
make it easy to create multi threaded C++ applications.

The library is closely modelled after the C++11 standard, but only a subset is
implemented at the moment.

See the documentation in the doc/html directory for more information.


Using TinyThread++
------------------

To use TinyThread++ in your own project, just add tinythread.cpp and
tinythread.h to your project. In your own code, do:

#include <tinythread.h>
using namespace tthread;

If you wish to use the fast_mutex class, include fast_mutex.h:

#include <fast_mutex.h>


Building the test programs
--------------------------

From the test folder, issue one of the following commands:

Linux, Mac OS X, OpenSolaris etc:
  make   (you may need to use gmake on some systems)

Windows/MinGW:
  mingw32-make

Windows/MS Visual Studio:
  nmake /f Makefile.msvc


History
-------

v1.1 - 2012.05.07
  - Added thread::detach().

v1.0 - 2010.10.01
  - First non-beta release.
  - Made mutex non-recursive (according to spec), and added recursive_mutex.
  - General class, code & documentation improvements.
  - Added a Makefile for MS Visual Studio.

v0.9 - 2010.08.10
  - Added preliminary support for this_thread::sleep_for().

v0.8 - 2010.07.02
  - Switched from CreateThread() to _beginthreadex() for Win32 (should fix
    tiny memory leaks).
  - Better standards compliance and some code cleanup.

v0.7 - 2010.05.17
  - Added this_thread::yield().
  - Replaced the non-standard number_of_processors() function with
    thread::hardware_concurrency(), which is part of the C++0x draft.
  - The thread::id() class is now more standards compliant (correct namespace
    and comparison operators).

v0.6 - 2010.04.28
  - Added a fast_mutex class (in fast_mutex.h).
  - Made the test.cpp application compile under Mac OS X and MinGW/g++ 3.x.

v0.5 - 2010.03.31
  - Added the thread_local keyword (support for thread-local storage).
  - Added a test application to test the API (test.cpp).
  - Improved the Doxygen documentation.

v0.4 - 2010.03.27
  - Added thread::get_id() and this_thread::get_id().
  - Changed the namespace name from tinythread to tthread.

v0.3 - 2010.03.24
  - Fixed a compiler error for fractal.cpp under MS Visual C++.
  - Added colors to the fractal generator.

v0.2 - 2010.03.23
  - Better C++0x conformance.
  - Better documentation.
  - New classes:
    - lock_guard
  - New member functions:
    - thread::joinable()
    - thread::native_handle()
    - mutex::try_lock()
  - Added a multi threaded fractal generator test application.

v0.1 - 2010.03.21
